# Floating_Point_adder
addition of 2 single precision IEEE 754 standard  floating point numbers in verilog 

[a simple guide on representation of  single precision IEEE 754 standard  floating point numbers](image.png)

there are also 2 files for testing the addition, its the testbench and the hex file that contains the number and the answer of the operation.

you shlould add both these files to the project folder to simulate and verify the verilog code via your simulation software (modelsim is prefered)
